# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is a project for a Coursera course on getting and cleaning data from by Johns Hopkins University
<https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning>

### Data used in the project

This R.script was invented to analyze the data from the [**UCI HAR Dataset**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Obviously, it is supposed to work if that archive mentioned exists on the same working directory as the script.

The following files were used from the initial dataset:

- ***feature.txt*** - description of the features
- ***train/X_train.txt*** - measurements of the features in the train set
- ***test/X_test.txt*** - measurements of the features in the test set
- ***train/subject_train.text*** - subjects for the measurements in the train set
- ***test/subject_test.text*** - subjects for the measurements in the test set
- ***train/y_train.text*** - activity for each measurement in the train set
- ***test/y_test.text*** - activity for each measurement in the test set
